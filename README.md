# Computer-Vision-Hockey-Game
  This is a hockey game based on Computer Vision in Python.  I used pygame and opencv.
 Requires two players. The one on the left controls the player from the keyboard and the one on the right controls the player via web cam with Hand Detection.
The puck changes color in each half of the field for better visibility. 
At the each goal the speed increase with 5 unit. When the score of player from the right side is 3. Another red puck is throw on the game, but this one is trying score only to the right side player.
When the speed reaches 50 units, the game is over!
